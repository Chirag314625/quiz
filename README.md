# Frontend Developer Intern Assignment — Quiz Application

This repository contains the solution for the Frontend Developer Intern assignment, implementing a responsive (desktop-first) Quiz Application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design aims for pixel-perfect fidelity based on the provided Figma design (if any was given, or a hypothetical one if not), with a strong focus on accessibility and a modern user experience enhanced by micro-interactions.

## ✨ Features Implemented

* **Next.js + TypeScript Scaffold:** Robust foundation for a performant and type-safe React application.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Configured for rapid UI development and pixel-perfect design implementation.
* **Modern Quiz UI:** A clean, card-based interface focused on clarity and user engagement.
    * **Progress Tracking:** Clear display of current question number and overall progress.
    * **Countdown Timer:** Integrated visual timer for time-sensitive quizzes.
    * **Interactive Answer Cards:** Selectable options with clear hover and selected states.
    * **Intuitive Navigation:** "Previous" and "Next/Submit" buttons with appropriate disabled states.
* **Pixel-Perfect Design (Desktop-First):** UI crafted to match the Figma specifications (or detailed blueprint) for desktop viewports.
* **Smooth Transitions & Animations:** Leverages **Framer Motion** for fluid UI element transitions and interactive feedback (e.g., question slides, answer card fades).
* **WCAG 2.1 Accessibility:** Implemented with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, appropriate ARIA attributes, and focus management for an inclusive user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url-here>
    cd WC-assignment
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url-here>` with the actual URL from your GitHub repo)*

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## 📝 Notes & Assumptions

* **Figma Design Reference:** This implementation is based on a detailed design blueprint (or an assumed Figma file, if one was not explicitly provided), striving for pixel-perfect accuracy for desktop layouts.
* **Desktop-First Approach:** The primary focus for the layout and responsiveness is desktop screens.
* **Question/Answer Data:** Placeholder data is used for quiz questions and answers. In a real application, this would typically come from an API.
* **Framer Motion:** Integrated for enhanced animations as discussed in the design phase.
