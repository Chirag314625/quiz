# Frontend Intern Assignment — Starter Implementation

This repo is a starter scaffold for the Frontend Developer Intern assignment. It uses Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS and includes a small, accessible header and hero section with smooth animations using Framer Motion.

What you'll find here
- Next.js + TypeScript scaffold
- Tailwind CSS configured
- `components/Header.tsx` — accessible navigation
- `components/Hero.tsx` — animated hero with CTA

Getting started (local)
1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Manisha\Documents\timepass\WC-assignment"
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes & assumptions
- This scaffold focuses on desktop-first layout. The Figma design was not attached; replace placeholder assets and tweak spacing/colors to achieve pixel-perfect fidelity.
- You'll need to run `npm install` locally to fetch dependencies. The repository contains configuration files and components to continue building.

Deploying
- Vercel: import the repo and use the default Next.js settings.

Next steps for completion
- Replace the hero image placeholder with exported Figma assets.
- Add more pages/sections per Figma (features, pricing, contact).
- Add tests and aria/keyboard tests for accessibility verification.

Time spent: ~20 minutes creating scaffold and sample components.
